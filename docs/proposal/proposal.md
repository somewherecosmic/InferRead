## SECTION B


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

This project covers the area of of Computational Lingustics & Machine Learning. This project will make use of language prediction to identify words & phrases within an incoming, user uploaded text. The purpose of which is to provide assistance in the learning of a spoken language. It will make use of a user profile to store the user's known words. The web app will perform frequency analysis & word frequency to rank a text in terms of difficulty in comparison to a user word bank.

Each instance of a "reading session" will POST to the backend, updating the users wordbank if they declared a novel word as known or indicating difficulty with another word.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

This project is designed to be a language learning tool, a user will begin engaging it with some amount of comfort in their language of choice ( Irish or French ), enough to feel confident starting to read documents in their selected language. Our web app hopes to support language reading through inferrence & context. In order to provide this, we want to ananlyse text within a document through machine learning. To the level in which a document scanned could identify words but also common phrases. In addition, through a language prediction model, we want to provide alternative words that would make sense (provide synonyms to the user essentially).

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

The idea originated from both students have a previous passion for language learning, Ryan is an intermediate learner of Irish and Ethan is an intermediate learner of French, we are also big readers. As a result, we both desired a convenient, accessible way to improve our language learning through reading. Essentially, we both want to use an application like the one we propose.

Other applications that assist in language learning we found to be beginner-centric, things that introduce grammar & basic vocabulary. But we could not find a similar program that matches our desires, we believe it would possibly fill a gap in the market if published or at the minimum be a helpful tool for learners.

The name Infer-Read is a play on words from INFERrence Read, to be akin to Infrared.


### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

This application is aimed at intermediate learners, those who have a solid understanding of the fundamentals but want to expand their literacy. A user could log on, scan or select a document and be informed of the difficulty of the text. Text difficult would be based on a few factors;
1. Idioms, phrases, sayings, etc.
2. Novel words to the user
3. Word complexity
4. Frequency analysis of most commonly used words.

When a text is chosen, novel words are highlighted, allowing the user to select the word, rate their understanding of the word and if known, add it to their word bank, and if not:
- Provide instances of the selected unknown word to the learner in other contexts.
- Provide synonyms of unseen words when selected that the learner is already familiar with, allowing the learner to consider the meaning via inference

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

As stated this tool would be useful for expanding your vocabulary in the chosen language, we believe that the reading of texts would also enhance the users ability to conjugate sentences within the language or at the minimum gain confidence within it.

For users with a good vocabulary, the application would also provide an avenue for learning phrases & sayings, a source of pain for all language learners.

From a business perspective, this tool could be incorpoated as a strong component of an existing language learning tool. Catering to a more advanced learner. For users of language tools such as Duolingo or Babbel, they could at best, read a short story written for the language tool. This is dissatisfactory for numerous reasons;
1. They are usually extremely basic.
2. Not interesting reading material, e.g. story of a woman going to the bus stop.
3. Limited by its purpose to cater to an extremely large audience e.g. it would not incorporate cultural elements, phrases, literature style writing, etc.

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
